# genai-samples by PeterChan@AWS

Welcome to the genai-samples repository! This is a showcase of projects and code samples generated using advanced AI models, primarily Claude 3.5 Sonnet, through platforms like Cursor.com and Amazon Q Developer.

## Overview

This repository serves as a demonstration of the power and potential of adopting AI in software development. Here, you'll find a collection of projects and code snippets that have been created with the assistance of generative AI models.

## Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:

1. To showcase the capabilities of AI-assisted coding
2. To provide examples of how AI can be integrated into the development workflow
3. To inspire developers to explore and adopt AI tools in their projects

## Contents

This repository will be continuously updated with new projects and samples. Each project will be contained in its own directory, with its own README and documentation.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the projects, examine the code, and use them as inspiration or learning resources. Each project will include information about the AI model and platform used in its creation.

## Contributing

While this repository is primarily maintained by Peter to showcase AI-generated code, contributions and feedback are welcome. If you have suggestions or want to discuss the projects, please open an issue.

## Disclaimer

The code in this repository is generated by AI models and may require human review and testing before use in production environments.

Happy exploring, and welcome to the future of AI-assisted development!
